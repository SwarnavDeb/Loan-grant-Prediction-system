# Loan-grant-Prediction-system
In this project I've automated the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. Here the customer base is segmented based on their eligibility and as such the customers are targeted.

# Dataset Information

The data has 615 rows and 13 columns. The aim is to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that the customers can specifically be targeted.
